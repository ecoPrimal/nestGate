//
// This module provides production-ready fallbacks for development environments
// that don't have dedicated ZFS storage hardware available.
//
// ## When This Module Is Used
// - Development laptops without ZFS pools
// - Container environments (Docker, Podman)
// - CI/CD systems without storage hardware
// - Testing environments that need storage API compatibility
//
// ## Important: This is NOT Test Code
// These implementations are production-ready abstractions that allow
// the full NestGate system to run in environments without dedicated
// storage hardware. They provide real functionality through alternative
// means (filesystem operations, system calls, etc.).
